Access to high-performance computing resources is essential for conducting academic and scientific research. However, acquiring and maintaining high-performance \glspl{desktop} is a challenge for public higher education institutions due to the existence of complex and lengthy bidding processes. On the other hand, university students from low-income families, who do not have the financial means to purchase a personal computer, may have difficulties carrying out academic activities both inside and outside the university. Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop a \gls{vdi} system capable of enabling students and researchers from higher education institutions to access virtual \glspl{desktop} allocated in the public cloud through any device with internet access and web browser support, improving the management of the most powerful computing resources, as they are consumed as a service instead of being acquired through complex and lengthy bidding processes.
